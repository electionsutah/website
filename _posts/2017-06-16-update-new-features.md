I've added some new features since first launching the website a couple of days ago. You'll notice a new design as well as the ability to browse all candidates on the <strong>[People](../../../../../people/)</strong> and <strong>[Places](../../../../../places/)</strong> pages. More candidates will be added as we gather that data from various county clerk's records. For now, only <strong>[Salt Lake County's](../../../../../places/salt-lake/)</strong> municipal candidates are listed on the website.

I'm excited about the future of the project and hope to have more and more useful information available for the public shortly.
