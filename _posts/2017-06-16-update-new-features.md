I've added some new features since first launching the website a couple of days ago. You'll notice a new design as well as the ability to browse all candidates on the <strong>[People](../../../../../people/)</strong> and <strong>[Places](../../../../../places/)</strong> pages. More candidates will be added as we gather that data from various county clerk's records. For now, only <strong>[Salt Lake County's](../../../../../places/salt-lake/)</strong> municipal candidates are listed on the website. Also, site search is coming soon. I've never built out my own site search, so I'm still teaching myself how to do it!

I'm excited about the future of the project and hope to have more and more useful information available for the public shortly. Thank you for visiting!
