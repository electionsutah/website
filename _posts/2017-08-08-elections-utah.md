I finally had enough time/will power to move the project from my personal website to a new web domain, **ElectionsUtah.org**. Along with the new location, we've added more candidates from **[Utah](../../../../../places/utah)** and **[Weber](../../../../../places/weber)** counties, and have added a lot of candidate details.

We still need to fix search so it actually works (sorry!) and then it's onto adding the rest of the remaining counties in time for the municipal election in November. We have new volunteers and coverage and I can't express how thankful and excited I am to be building such a worthwhile public service.


Take care of yourselves!
