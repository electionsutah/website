This is the beginning of what I hope will become an ongoing community-driven effort to provide more up-to-date information on local elections within the State of Utah. All of the data is openly licensed as [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) and is in the public domain.

I will have more details soon about the scope and direction of the project. Take care until then!
