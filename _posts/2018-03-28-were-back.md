After a long hiatus, we have published the [2018 primary candidates](/people/#2018-election) for review. We're still cleaning the [candidate filing data](https://elections.utah.gov/2018-candidate-filings) from the State, so please contact us if something seems off.

I'm excited about this year's election and hope this project becomes more useful and intuitive as we continue to work on it. Look for more updates from us on the website and on social media.


Take care of yourselves!
